# ConvertUpLeads Parent (React + TS + Vite)

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.
Currently, two official plugins are available:

## Project setup

> 1. convert .env.example to .env

With Yarn:

```shell
yarn install
```

With Yarn:

```shell
yarn dev
```

## Every file import file sequence format

```textmate
1. react and react other files
2. redux && react-router
3. third party package like "@mui/core", "date-fns" etc.
4. component
5. others ...
```

Happy Coding :)
